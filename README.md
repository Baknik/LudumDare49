Wrest control of physics out of the hands of mother nature and into your hands, which are holding a physics-manipulating gun!

This is a prototype for a project idea I've been wanting to expand upon. If you enjoy the concept, or have constructive criticism, please feel free to let me know. Thanks for playing!
